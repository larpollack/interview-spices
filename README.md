## Thanks for your interest in Tomo!

We are really grateful you'd consider working with us and are excited to continue the conversation. We've set up a small project here that will allow us to have a relevant conversation about our open senior level position.

We've described some tasks below and the nature of the application. Spend enough time with it (generally no more than a couple of hours), to be able to show some progress and have a great conversation.

## Getting Started

We have the VERY start of our new Spice Blend application! We've just started by creating a new Next.js App, and have a very basic API to work with. We want to have a scrappy version of our application to demo to interested parties ASAP.

What we want to show in the demo (and the interview) is the following:

* A basic home page, with minimal styling, that we can ask google to index.
* Links to our list of spices and blends. We'd love to be able to search/or filter on these lists.
* Those lists should link to the detail pages for an individual spice (started), and individual blend (bonus, you'll have to extend the API).
* Try to find a place to show us some of your strengths as a FE developer within this project. For example: add a feature, refactor something, show some great styling skills, ETC. We're not looking for anything specific, we're just interested in learning more about you!

### Clarifications
* There is no way we can speed up the API calls themselves. Leave the setTimeouts in the api file alone please =)
* We're interested in SEO and performance at Tomo. It would be great to be able to talk about those in the interview!
* We want to use typescript, but our scrappy start hasn't done a great job of it... It would be great if you could demonstrate some typescript understanding/improvements with your work.
* If you need to write your own API endpoint, feel free to do so, but don't alter the base API endpoints and timeouts. 
* Feel free to use any/all resources available to you, just be sure to be able to talk about your decisions and sources.

## Submission
Feel free to ask any questions you have along the way! When you've spent enough time with it to have a great 1 hour long review session that demonstrates your strengths, go ahead and submit it. You can host it on a public repo, or you can zip it up and send to us in the same way we shared it with you. Again, thank you for your time and interest!
